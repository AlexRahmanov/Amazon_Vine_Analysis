# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

# Project Overview
For this project we collected reviews data regarding pet products games and used Pyspark to conduct the ETL process of extracting, transforming and connecting the data to a database that we created via the AWS server. Once this process was complete an analysis was carried out to determine if there was a favorable review bias from the Vine members in our data set.
